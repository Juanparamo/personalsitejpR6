        I'm going to ask of your building process for websites so let's go over some basic structure stuff. Below is a mock website, We need to fill in the tags to make it look proper. 
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>&lsaquo; html &rsaquo;</h3>
          <h4>&lsaquo; head &rsaquo;</h4>
          <h4>&lsaquo; /head&rsaquo;</h4>

        We Talked about Git Hub recently. Now i want to go over some basic concepts. These concepts are out of order. Put them back into order.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ol>
      <li>git add </li>
        <li>git commit</li>

    <div>
      <p>
        No doubt you've looked at c9 yesterday and had a hard time figuring out how to add your own styles to the classes themselves. This is actually going to address that in a way that is easy to remember.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>&lsaquo;link rel=''  href='' &rsaquo;</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Link hrefs should go on a relative path. using what we talked about yesterday. how would you link the CSS file inside of the CSS folder? 
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>cd css</li>
      <li> touch style.css </li>
      </ol>
    </div> 
    <div>
      <h1>
        You Made It through! Now create a new document with the name "jul17" in c9 and copy and paste this.
